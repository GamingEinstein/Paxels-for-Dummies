## About
Paxels for Dummies adds a suite of tools calls Paxels, which are a combination of a Pickaxe, Axe and Shovel. To make one, simply combine the three tools in your inventory or in a crafting table.

This mod was made with the intention of being both cross-platform and consistently updated to the latest major modding versions. Eventually, I might even add support for different mods (no promises, but it's on my radar)
