## About
Paxels for Dummies adds a suite of tools calls Paxels, which are a combination of a Pickaxe, Axe and Shovel. To make one, simply combine the three tools in your inventory or in a crafting table.

This mod was made with the intention of being both cross-platform (see FAQ) and consistently updated to the latest major modding versions. Eventually, I might even add support for different mods (no promises, but it's on my radar)

## FAQ
Q: **Can you port it to (insert version here) or (insert mod loader here)?**<br>
A: Currently, the only versions I will be supporting is what's listed under *Installation Requirements*. If I see fit, I will do my own ports to ensure quality and consistency

Q: **Where are the Fabric versions?**<br>
A: I've been trying to make my mods work under both Fabric and (Neo)Forge, but it's been quite difficult do to many differences between the mod loaders. Mainly, I just can't seem to get Fabric to work the way I want it to. So until I understand Fabric as well as I do (Neo)Forge, those versions will be coming at a later date or possibly not at all. It is on my radar, though, so don't worry too much about it

Q: **Can you add (insert idea here)?**<br>
A: You can leave suggestions for the mod on my Discord

Q: **Why is this a question?**<br>
A: Why not
